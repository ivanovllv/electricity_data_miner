# electricity_data_miner

This is a simple program that I wrote in a couple of hours in order to save my time. 
My goal was to collect data about electricity prices in Russian electricity market from a website of a System Operator. 
The problem is that there is no constructed database for the certain period, just single-day data; hence, you need to visit plenty of pages (changing GET parameter which represents date).
Therefore, you have to do enormous amount of job trying to obtain data for periods more than several months.

So, I wrote a simple program that allows you to obtain data for a certain period and construct it into handy database.
This helped me in my research work in Master degree.

Though this code is a bloody mess, I put it here just to not lose it.
